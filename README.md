  ## <a id="DESCRIPTION"> DESCRIPTION</a>
  This project is designed to create an index html file that takes in the input from the user using node in the terminal then creating cards based on the users input to show the team they have. The user can select from 3 types of roles. The user will always be required to fill out the Manager role but will have the option to add an "engineer" or an "intern" class that can then be filled out and added to the generation of the html page

  ## <a id="INSTALLATION"> INSTALLATION</a>
  Node, NPM I Inquierer, Npm i Jest 

  ## <a id="USAGE"> USAGE</a>
  The application can be initialized by running the "node index" command in the terminal to start after making sure the required dependencies have been installed. Once the program is run the user will fill out the relative information with the relative role that they have been  prompted. Upon filling out this field the console will log back the object of the class that was just created to confirm the information and make it visible for the user. The user can then create as many interns or engineers as they like but once hitting the "NO" option when prompted would they like to add any more users the application will then run the generation script that will then create the "team.html" file which will then be displayable to the user.
